# ML-project-on-house_price_prediction
To predict the selling price of a house based on its features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
Here’s a detailed **README.md** template for your **House Price Prediction** GitHub project:

## 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

### 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as number of rooms, square footage, location, etc., using machine learning regression techniques. It includes the full ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
